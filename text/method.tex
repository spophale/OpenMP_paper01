We look closely at the different hardware counters available on the new POWER8 system to better understand the effects of data affinity and thread placement. Performance instrumentation in POWER8 is provided in two layers: the \textbf{Core Level Performance Monitoring} (CLPM) and the \textbf{Nest Level Performance Monitoring} (NLPM). CLPM allows for monitoring of the core pipeline efficiency of the front-end, branch prediction, schedulers etc., along with behavioral metrics such as stalls, execution rates, thread prioritization and resource sharing, and utilizations of resources etc. On the other hand NLPM provides a way to instrument the L3 cache, interconnect fabric and memory channels/controllers. POWER8 has an enhanced Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) Accounting Model. The POWER8 CPI Stack accounts for stalled, waiting to complete, thread blocked, completion table empty, completion and other miscellaneous cycles. The stalled cycles are further classified based on the cause of the stall. Newly added to this group for the POWER8 architecture is the finer granularity of \textit{ Stall cycles due to Dcache Misses}. Since we want to prevent cycles wasted due to data misses, we focus on the sub-set of hardware counters mentioned in table~\ref{tab:hwct}. Here we focus on the \texxtbf{data cache} stall cycles to better understand the overhead of using different \textit{bind} and \textit{place} configurations. The collection of the counter values are enabled by a system provided script. This allows for access to counters that may not be represented as literary strings and accessible via other application profiling tools.
