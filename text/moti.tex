The new Exascale system at ORNL, Summit, will be an OpenPOWER system with NVIDIA GPUs. To provide a better understand of the working of OpenMP 
programs on this novel architecture we look at the most impactful aspects of the programming model. By examining the POWER8 hardware counters while testing the OpenMP 4.0 affinity features implemented in different compilers available on the new system, we hope to measure effects of affinity at scale. Based on this study, we describe the challenges that we faced in quantifying effects of affinity, inadequacy in the current OpenMP programming model and how some of these may be addressed in OpenMP 5.0. We also endeavor to find the optimum OpenMP settings for different application kernels that can yield the best performance.
